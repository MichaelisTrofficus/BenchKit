## Contribution Steps

1. [Build a Local Copy](#build-from-source)
2. Create a new branch
3. [Add your contributions](#contributing-your-code)
4. Create a Pull Request in the [benchkit](https://github.com/bench-ai/benchkit/pulls) repo
5. Celebrate once your code gets merged!

### Build From Source

- Start off by forking your own personal copy of `benchkit`
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/benchkit.git
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/bench-ai/benchkit.git
  ```
- Now build the local version

  - Requirements
    - python >= 3.10
    - OS: MacOS, Linux, Windows
  - Make a virtual environment
    ```shell
    python3.10 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - Install poetry(the build tool)
    ```shell
    pip install poetry
    ```
  - Install all requirements
    ```shell
    poetry install
    ```

### Contributing your code

- Only code in the `src` folder
- Write appropriate tests in the `tests` folder
- Before you commit your code it must meet some requirements

  1. It must pass all tests
  2. It must be formatted following `black` standards

  3. Run this command to ensure all tests are passed, this will
     also ensure your code gets converted to the `black` format
     ```shell
     nox
     ```
  4. flake8 standards are also followed so any issues documented during the nox
     process must be resolved.
